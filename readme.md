Administrator is an administrative interface builder for [Laravel](http://laravel.com). With Administrator you can visually manage your Eloquent models and their relations, and also create stand-alone settings pages for storing site data and performing site tasks.

## Composer


To install Administrator as a Composer package to be used with Laravel 5.8, simply run:

```sh
composer require "exodusanto/administrator: 5.8.*"
```

Once it's installed, you can register the service provider in `config/app.php` in the `providers` array:

```php
'providers' => [
    'Frozennode\Administrator\AdministratorServiceProvider',
]
```

Then publish Administrator's assets with `php artisan vendor:publish`. This will add the file `config/administrator.php`. This [config file](http://administrator.frozennode.com/docs/configuration) is the primary way you interact with Administrator. This command will also publish all of the assets, views, and translation files.

### Laravel 4

If you want to use Administrator with Laravel 4, you need to resolve to Administrator 4:

```json
"exodusanto/administrator": "4.*"
```

Then publish the config file with `php artisan config:publish frozennode/administrator`. This will add the file `app/config/packages/frozennode/administrator/administrator.php`.

Then finally you need to publish the package's assets with the `php artisan asset:publish frozennode/administrator` command.

### Laravel 3

Since Administrator has switched over to Composer, you can no longer use `php artisan bundle:install administrator` or `php artisan bundle:upgrade administrator`. If you want to use Administrator with Laravel 3, you must switch to the [3.3.2 branch](https://github.com/FrozenNode/Laravel-Administrator/tree/3.3.2), download it, and add it in the `/bundles/administrator` directory and add this to your bundles.php file:

```php
'administrator' => array(
    'handles' => 'admin', //this determines what URI this bundle will use
    'auto' => true,
),
```
